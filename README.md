# Insulting-Comment
Here is a project from Kaggle's Contest to decide if a comment is insult or not. 

# Summary
In this project I tried to experiment with Naive Bayes's scores before and after data's 'cleaning'. Also I practised with bigrams and Laplace Smoothing. Finally one significant term of contest is that a comment can be characterizes as insult only when somebody is insulting somebody else (not something general). So for that reason I attached importance to pronouns, thinking that when somebody insults another person usually uses words like 'you','your'. So the sum of pronouns of each comment would be my new feature.
